    '\n        reinit(Decoder self, Config config)\n\n        Reinitialize the decoder with updated configuration.\n\n        This function allows you to switch the acoustic model, dictionary, or\n        other configuration without creating an entirely new decoding object.\n\n        The decoder retains ownership of the pointer config, so you must not\n        attempt to free it manually. If you wish to reuse it elsewhere, call\n        cmd_ln_retain() on it.\n\n        Parameters:\n        -----------\n\n        ps:  Decoder.\n\n        config:  An optional new configuration to use. If this is NULL, the\n        previous configuration will be reloaded, with any changes applied.\n\n        0 for success, <0 for failure. \n        '
