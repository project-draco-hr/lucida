def add_word(self, *args):
    '\n        add_word(Decoder self, char const * word, char const * phones, int update)\n\n        Add a word to the pronunciation dictionary.\n\n        This function adds a word to the pronunciation dictionary and the\n        current language model (but, obviously, not to the current FSG if FSG\n        mode is enabled). If the word is already present in one or the other,\n        it does whatever is necessary to ensure that the word can be\n        recognized.\n\n        Parameters:\n        -----------\n\n        word:  Word string to add.\n\n        phones:  Whitespace-separated list of phoneme strings describing\n        pronunciation of word.\n\n        update:  If TRUE, update the search module (whichever one is currently\n        active) to recognize the newly added word. If adding multiple words,\n        it is more efficient to pass FALSE here in all but the last word.\n\n        The internal ID (>= 0) of the newly added word, or <0 on failure. \n        '
